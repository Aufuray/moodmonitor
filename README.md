Alexa Build-a-thon Mood Monitor Skill for Seniors and Elderly citizens

## Problem Statement of our target audience
> Lack of communication with friends and family
> Fear of interupting busy schedule of friends and family
> Need for companionship and personal connection
> Need to monitor health while maintaining independence
> Lack of confidence in oneâ€™s ability to use technology effectively

## Idea
> An application that enables you tell Alexa how you feel during the day.
> Alexa is able to suggest activities for you depending on your mood.
If you're happy and the weather is good, Alexa can list out all the events available for you to attend today
If you're sad, Alexa can offer to tell you a joke or play you a favorite song
If you're lonely, Alexa can tell you a story to cheer you up.
If you're ill, Alex can connect to the 'teledoctor' platform, or put you in touch with your PCP
> At the end of every week, Alexa sends a report of your reported mood to your care-giver, family, or doctor.
> If Alexa doesn't hear from you for a couple of days, she can send an email or text message to your care-giver, to ensure that everything is alright 

## Enter MoodBuddy/MoodMonitor
> Our product provides the elderly with three main functions; it gives them somebody to talk to, helps them plan out their daily schedule, and tracks their overall physical and mental health.

> This addresses the problems that many elderly people have with being on their own. 
They crave autonomy but still need a gentle reminder to take care of themselves. This piece of technology is a humanistic daily contact point for them, which creates a personal relationship that adheres to a schedule. 

> This provides simplistic stability for elders, likewise helping them feel more comfortable with modern technology.

> Our product is unique in that it offers more than an automated scripted response to consumers. Alexa will ideally have a list of unique responses that she can use to answer each particular mood that a person expresses. Our application is more of a dialogue between two people than a constant questioning of Alexa.
